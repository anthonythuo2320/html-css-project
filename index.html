        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
          dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
          specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
          essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
          passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>

        <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at
          its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed
          to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and
          web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many
          web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes
          on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p><a href="https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/html-css-project"> Click here for more info.</a>

        <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some
          form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use
          a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All
          the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first
          true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model
          sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always
          free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/eu-referendum-brexit-win-or-lose-what-will-happen-to-david-cameron-conservative-party-a7091226.html">The Brexit Question.</a>
